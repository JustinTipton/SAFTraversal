# SAFTraversal

A study into tree traversal times for Safe access framework.

Note: my phone does have some problems with freezing every 5 seconds, so times are impacted for SAF, probably upwards of +2-3 seconds.

* `java.io.File` traversal: ~1.9 seconds for 45719 files.
* SAF traversal: ~15 seconds for 45719 files.
